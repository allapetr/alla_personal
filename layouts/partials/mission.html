                <p>Since I can remember, I have lived for and breathed music. For 20 years, I studied how to play with this resonating wooden box called a violin and at some point along the way I realized that what I enjoy most and what fascinates me is teaching others around the world how to do it too. I have seen again and again how music shaped my own life and that of others and my mission is to create the opportunity for others to experience it as well.</p>
