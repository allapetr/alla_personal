Violinist Alla Petrichei started her musical journey in her native Romania where she performed extensively as soloist at national festivals and competitions. In 2011, Alla moved to the United Kingdom to persue her Baccalaureate as a full HMC scholar at St Peter’s School, York. There she received the 2012 Music Award and performed at St Patrick’s Cathedral, New York and Leeds Town Hall, Leeds.

In 2013, Alla became a student at the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester and subsequently received guidance from violinists such as Alexander Sitkovetsky, Christian Tetzlaff, Henning Kraggerud, Henk Guittart and Jack Liebeck. Her feature as soloist on stage in the RNCM production of The Merry Widow opera by Franz Lehár in 2014 and her masterclasses with pedagogue Mauricio Fuks in 2018 represent life changing experiences for her at the RNCM. She graduated in 2017 and is currently completing her Masters in Performance.

Alongside her studies, Alla appears regularly as soloist with orchestra and recitalist in venues across the United Kingdom. Highlights are her performances of Concerto No 1 by Max Bruch with Wigan Youth Symphony Orchestra and Gorton Philharmonic Orchestra as well as her performance of Carmen Fantasy by Pablo de Sarasate with the latter for an audience of 800 people. In addition, Alla premiered ‘Snowsuit’ by John Uren and created her own syncretic collaborative project with two poets, a painter and a photographer focusing on J.S. Bach’s Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin.

Alla loves teaching violin and enjoys practising Dalcroze Eurhythmics and Feldenkrais.
