Alongside being a violinist, I am also a passionate violin teacher and now I specialize in online teaching because I truly believe this is the most powerful way I can serve the world. I have been a teacher for more than 8 years and I taught both privately and in collaboration with established international educational programs. My experience teaching many students of all ages and from many corners of the world has given me the ability not only to teach people how to play the violin and understand music, but also through music to empower students in their day to day life.
