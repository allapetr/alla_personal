Alla Petrichei is a current graduate student at the Jacobs School of Music, Bloomington, Indiana, US and a recent Masters of Music graduate of the Royal Northern College of Music (RNCM), Manchester, UK.  Alongside developing her performing career, Alla is a passionate violin teacher who loves helping students of all ages enhance their musical experience and enjoy themselves when playing. 


Alla is the founder of Violin Plus, an online platform which offers violin, viola and general music training for all ages and levels. Her teaching experience includes delivering private violin lessons for 4 years in Manchester, UK, undertaking a one-year teaching placement with the RNCM Young Strings Programme (2017-2018) and teaching violin and chamber music in the RNCM Young Strings Summer School 2018. Alla was also a violin tutor at the Antigua Music Camp 2017 in Antigua and Barbuda, where she taught individuals, small groups and large ensembles full time for three weeks. In 2016, Alla volunteered to lead a 20-hour violin course for six beginner adults at the Manchester International Society and in 2015, she assisted several classes taught by the Artis Education Programme integrating music, movement and drama with year 1 and 2 students in two Primary Schools in Manchester.

Alla also participated in the European String Teachers Association (ESTA) Conference (2016 and 2017) and attended various teaching workshops including ‘An ABRSM introduction to teaching’, ‘How to lead ensembles in schools’ and ‘The use of Dalcroze Eurhythmics in teaching’. In addition, she undertook a ‘Practical Pedagogy’ module as part of her studies at the RNCM. 

Alla believes that providing a holistic and ‘body and mind friendly’ approach to music and violin playing to her students is crucial. She therefore took part in the 2018 Dalcroze Summer Course at the Institut Jaques Dalcroze, Geneva, Switzerland, as well as in the 2018 Easter and Summer Courses organised by Dalcroze and Kodály UK. In addition, Alla is currently training to become a certified Dalcroze Eurhythmics teacher and receives regular training in Alexander Technique and Feldenkrais method, all of which are integrated in her lessons.
